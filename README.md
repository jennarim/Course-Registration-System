# Course-Registration-System

Allows a user to login as either a student or an admin, allowing different functionalities for each.
An admin can create a course, delete a course, edit a course, display information of a course, register a student, view all available courses, view full courses, write to a file a list of full courses, view the names of students in a certain course, view a course's list of students, and sort the list of courses. 
A student can view all available courses, view courses that are not full, register for a course, withdraw from a course, and view all courses current student is registered in.
